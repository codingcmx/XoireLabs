## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant emerald green (#00FF80) to evoke a sense of innovation and futuristic technology, creating a visual association with advanced AI capabilities. Given the visionary quality of the brand, a bold, saturated color aligns well.
- Background color: Dark charcoal (#222222), providing a stark contrast to the bright primary color and enhancing the depth and cinematic feel of the site. It desaturates the primary hue while preserving an analogous quality.
- Accent color: Electric blue (#7DF9FF), positioned analogously to the primary emerald green, adds a striking highlight. Significantly brighter and more saturated than the primary, it draws the eye and reinforces the futuristic theme.
- Headline font: 'Audiowide' (sans-serif), giving a tech-focused, bold impression.
- Body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif), to ensure a clean, modern, and readable text.
- Animated vector icons that morph and react to user interaction, enhancing the 4D experience with subtle, dynamic feedback.
- Parallax scrolling with z-depth layering to create a sense of immersion, emphasizing the 3D aspects of the design across different sections.
- Use of Framer Motion and GSAP for cinematic transitions between sections, incorporating z-depth transitions to deepen the visual experience.
